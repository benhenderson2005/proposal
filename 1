# 1. The title of my project will be basketball 3 point contest
# 2. A game where you move around a basketball court shooting shots. The game will take your total points and time and put it on a leaderboard.
# 3. My software will be a game where a player has a certain amount of time to move around the basketball court and shoot threes. There will be a ball moving across a line and
# the player must click when it aligns with the hoop. There will be five ball racks, with 5 balls each. The last ball of each rack will have a ball worth two points, and before
# each game you can choose a rack to have every ball worth two points. Then the game will keep the top three scores and times and display them on a leaderboard. This will be executed
# in pygame.
# 4. I think a good outcome for my game is that everything works smoothly in the game but I don't have a leader board, and I don't have the extra point rack implemented.
# 5. I think a better outcome is everything works great and I have the leaderboard working. 
# 6. I think the best outcome is that everything works great, I have the leaderboard working and I have the extra point rack working. 
# 7. My next steps for this project are to download pygame onto my computer. I will need to know how to code using pygame and use it to make my game. I will also need to learn 
# how to make the sprites for my game. I can look up how to do these things.
